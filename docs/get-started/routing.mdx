# Routing

## Introduction

Liap provides a `POST` endpoint `liap.serverNotifications` to receive
the [Server notifications](/docs/category/server-notifications) from different providers. This route uses a query
variable `provider` to define the service provider.

| Provider    | URI                                        | Query Value |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Google Play | `/liap/notifications?provider=google-play` | google-play |
| App Store   | `/liap/notifications?provider=app-store`   | app-store   |

You can add custom configurations to this endpoint through the `routing` key in the config file `liap.php`. For
instance, you can assign a [middleware](https://laravel.com/docs/middleware) or add a custom route prefix.

```php title="config/liap.php"
[
    'routing' => [
        'signed' => false,
        'middleware' => 'my_middleware',
        'prefix' => 'my_prefix'
    ],

    // .. Other configurations are trimmed
]
```

## Generate a signed URL

In order to set up the server notifications, the service provider asks you to provide a URL to receive the server
notifications. LIAP allows you to easily create a "signed" URL which have a "signature" hash appended to the query
string. This allows LIAP/Laravel to verify that the URL has not been modified since it was created.

You can generate them using the following composer command:

```shell
php artisan liap:url
```

It will ask for the provider:

```shell
Select provider:
  [0] All Providers
  [1] App Store
  [2] Google Play
 >
```

If you didn't enable signed URLs, it will ask for your confirmation to
generate signed URLs:

```shell
Select provider:
  [0] All Providers
  [1] App Store
  [2] Google Play
 > 0

 Signed routes are disabled. Do you want to generate signed routes? (yes/no) [no]:
 > yes
```

Based on your answers, it will generate a table with the following columns:

```shell
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Provider    | URL                                                                                  |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| App Store   | https://yourdomain.com/liap/notifications?signature=<signature>&provider=app-store   |
| Google Play | https://yourdomain.com/liap/notifications?signature=<signature>&provider=google-play |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The generated URLs will be used to receive the [server notifications](/docs/category/server-notifications).

If the URLs start with `http://localhost`, you should modify your Laravel configuration, typically by setting the
APP_URL environment variable to your desired domain, and rerun `php artisan liap:url`. Do _not_ manually edit the
URLs, as that will invalidate the signature.

## Validating a signed route requests

In order to verify that an incoming request has a valid signature, you should set the `routing.signed` key to `true`.

```php title="config/liap.php"
[
    'routing' => [
        'signed' => true, // This is false by default
    ],

    // .. Other configurations are trimmed
]
```

If the incoming request does not have a valid signature, the middleware will automatically return a `403` HTTP response.
