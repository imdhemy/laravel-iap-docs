# Test Notifications

Both Google Play and App Store provide a way to test the server notifications, so you can verify that your server is
correctly set up to receive and handle the notifications.

## Google Play

After configuring the [Google Play RTDN](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/getting-ready#configure-rtdn),
and deploying your server with LIAP package enabled, You can test your configuration by using the **Send Test Message**
in the Google Play Console. If you have not configured a backend server to consume notifications, you can use the gcloud
command line tool to verify the configuration. For instructions on processing messages using gcloud, [see Pull the message
from the subscription](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publish-receive-messages-console#pull_the_message_from_the_subscription).

LIAP will automatically handle the test notifications and add a log entry similar to the following:

```shell
Google Play Test Notification, version: 1.0
```

## App Store

To check the status of the test App Store server notification sent to your server. You can use the folloiwing command:

```shell
php artisan liap:apple:test-notification
```

If you are testing on "sandbox" environment, you need to pass the `--sandbox` option:

```shell
php artisan liap:apple:test-notification --sandbox
```

The command will request a test notification and will show you the notification token.

LIAP will automatically handle the test notifications and add a log entry similar to the following:

If you are using Notifications `v1`:
```shell
AppStore Test Notification
```

If you are using Notifications `v2`:

```shell
AppStoreV2NotificationHandler: Test notification received
```
